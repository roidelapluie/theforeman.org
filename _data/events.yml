    There is always something happening in the Foreman project and we would
    like to share with you some recent changes and features that you might be
    interested in.
    First of all, long-awaited feature of Foreman is now here; Puppet 4 support
    was requested more than a year ago and now it should be fully compatible
    with Foreman.
    We will also go though some features that can be added to Foreman through
    plugins; remote execution as orthogonal tool to the standard config
    management tools and discovery for metal as as service capabilities.

    needed to go from "hey this is slow" through assembling all the data listed
    in https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Slow_Query_Questions.  He says: "I'm by
    no means a database expert, but I found that being able to assemble and
    examine the explain plan can make working with a developer or database
    expert very productive.  This tutorial is primarily for advanced users and
    developers, but anyone is welcome to attend."
